You then began to read documentation for AVAssetWriter, AVAssetWriterInput, AVAssetReader, AVAssetReaderVideoCompositionOutput, AVAssetReaderAudioMixOutput… and you went out of aspirin? SDAVAssetExportSession is a rewrite of AVAssetExportSession on top of AVAssetReader* and AVAssetWriter*. Unlike AVAssetExportSession, you are not limited to a set of presets – you have full access over audio and video settings.",
